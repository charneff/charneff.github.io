As I struggled to finish my 4th project after a weeks of various illnesses and setbacks, I realized my understanding of JavaScript was far below where I would like it needed to be. I ran through the curriculum with a goal of completion to catch up rather than comprehension of material. When faced with this realization, I opted to drop back a cohort. Do I wish that were not the case? Uh, yeah. Am I upset with myself for this being the case? Slightly. Do I feel this is the best decision for me at this point? Yes. Dedicating more time to this VERY important component of the curriculum absolutely what I need. If anyone finds themself in a similar situation, this is for you and for me....

This setback doesn't define you. This doesn't make you a failure. You are not inadequate. You are whole and complete just as you are.  It takes a lot of humility to self reflect and realize where your areas of opportunity are.  It takes a lot of courage to face those areas with compassion and understanding, refocusing your intention and getting back at it.  So, take a breath... dust yourself off... and begin again :)
