This project has been kicking my butt. It seems straight forward enough, but JS is definitely still a bit foreign to me. I'm writing this as I'm trying to finish up with my curriculum telling me it's overdue.... Yes, yes, I know it is. Thank you for the alert. With some features still to add, I'm looking forward to sorting out the details of this one and posting again about what I have learned this coming week.
