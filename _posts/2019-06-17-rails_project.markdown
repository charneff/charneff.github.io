My oh my, with each project I learn a lot, including just how much I do not know. Having an easier time with Sinatra, I underestimated the complexity of the relationships and intracacies of the code needed to fulfill the requirements. For this project, I built a craft beer review system. This allows you to add new beers and their breweries as well as review any beer created by any user. It prevents duplications, provides data validations, and allows for sign in via google or github using Omniauth. One important thing when dealing with building out secondary login platforms.... DO NOT  install devise unless you intend to use it. I started down one path and decided to go a different route. I was able to delete all of the necessary code that devise added. However, my database was irreversibly altered (unless someone knows how and would love to DM me ;) ). Despite frustrations, the project was incredibly gratifying.
